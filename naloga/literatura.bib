                computational complexity and explores its implications for
                computation at large. Computationally sound proofs provide, in a
                novel and meaningful framework, answers to old and new questions
                in complexity theory. In particular, given a random oracle or a
                new complexity assumption, they enable us to prove that verifying
                is easier than deciding for all theorems; provide a quite
                effective way to prove membership in computationally hard
                languages (such as \${\cal C}o\$-\$\cal N \cal P\$-complete
                ones); and show that every computation possesses a short
                certificate vouching its correctness. Finally, if a special type
                of computationally sound proof exists, we show that Blum's notion
                of program checking can be meaningfully broadened so as to prove
                that \$\cal N \cal P\$-complete languages are checkable. },

                together with the message. This is a rather surprising result
